# About me

Hi, my name is Tan Nguyen a.k.a Knight Hat, I'm a Java developer specified in creating plugins for Minecraft servers.
I've been coding for about three years now, mainly in Java, 
and have recently started exploring web development, both frontend and backend. 
My experience with Minecraft has allowed me to create plugins that add functionality 
and customization to servers, and I enjoy the challenge of building something that can 
enhance the gameplay experience for others.

# Career

As a YouTuber, I've also shared my knowledge and passion for Minecraft with others through tutorials
and gameplay videos. I believe that sharing knowledge and learning from others is an important part of
the development process, and I'm always looking for ways to collaborate and improve my skills.

# Hobbies

In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with different coding languages. I'm currently learning Javascript 
and excited to see where this journey takes me. I'm also into servers and large data processing, 
I've built several servers, mostly for local use. Some of my servers are currently running on 
cloud services such as AWS, Oracle Clouds, etc.
